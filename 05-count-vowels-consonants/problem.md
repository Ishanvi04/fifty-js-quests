**Task:**  
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and counts the number of **vowels** and **consonants** in it.

### 📌 Requirements:
- Ignore spaces, numbers, and special characters.
- Treat both uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.

### ✅ Example:

Input: `"JavaScript is awesome!"`  
Output:
