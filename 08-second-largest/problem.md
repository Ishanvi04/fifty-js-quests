# 🧠 Problem 08 - Second Largest Number in an Array

## 📌 Description

Given an array of numbers, find the **second largest** number.

You are NOT allowed to use any built-in sorting methods (`.sort()` etc.) for this problem.

This challenge will help improve your understanding of loops, comparisons, and edge cases.

## 🔍 Examples

- Input: `[4, 7, 1, 9, 3]`  
  Output: `7`

- Input: `[5, 5, 5, 3]`  
  Output: `3`

- Input: `[9]`  
  Output: `null` or a suitable message (only one number exists)

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Do NOT use `.sort()`
- Try solving it manually using loops
- Handle edge cases like arrays with:
  - only one number
  - all elements being equal

---

**Goal:** Practice comparisons, logic, and clean code.
