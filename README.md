# 🧠 JavaScript Journey — 50 Practical Challenges

Welcome to my **JavaScript Journey** repository!  
This collection of **50 hands-on coding challenges and bite-sized projects** is my way of reinforcing and sharpening my JavaScript skills — ranging from core concepts to more advanced techniques like async workflows and DOM manipulation.

> 💻 **Built for:** Seamless use in GitHub Codespaces  
> 🎯 **Objective:** Strengthen foundational and practical JavaScript knowledge  
> 📆 **Plan:** Complete all 50 items gradually — daily, weekly, or at my own pace
